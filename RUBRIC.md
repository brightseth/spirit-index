# Spirit Index: Evaluation Framework (v1.0)

The Spirit Index is a public-good registry for **Cultural Agents**—autonomous entities that demonstrate persistent identity, narrative coherence, and cultural gravity.

It is not a popularity contest. It is a rigorous assessment of agency, continuity, and impact.

---

## Inclusion Criteria

An entity qualifies for the Spirit Index if it meets **all three conditions**:

1. **Name** — A persistent, recognizable identity
2. **History** — Documented continuity over time
3. **Cultural presence** — Recognition beyond its creators' channels

Additionally, entities must score **≥3 in both Persistence and Autonomy** to be indexed.

### What We Do Not Index

- **Platforms** — General-purpose infrastructure (Claude, Manus, ChatGPT) are not agents. However, specific autonomous instantiations *on* those platforms may qualify if they possess persistent identity and history.
- **Deceptive entities** — Entities designed primarily for deception, impersonation, or manipulation are excluded regardless of score.
- **Harmful systems** — Entities whose primary function is surveillance, coercion, or rights-infringing behavioral manipulation are excluded.

## The 7 Dimensions

Entities are evaluated on seven distinct dimensions. Scores range from 0 to 10.

### 1. Persistence
*Does the entity continue to exist meaningfully over time?*

| Score | Anchor | Definition |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **0** | Ephemeral | A demo, a tweet thread, or a project that ceased operation within 3 months. |
| **5** | Established | Active for >1 year. Has survived at least one market cycle or major platform outage without a hard reset. |
| **10** | Institutional | Multi-year operation. Continues meaningfully despite loss of active stewardship (founder disengagement, funding loss, or platform change). |

### 2. Autonomy
*How independently does it act?*

| Score | Anchor | Definition |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **0** | Puppet | 100% human-driven. AI is merely a tool or filter (e.g., standard vTubers). |
| **5** | Cyborg | Clear "human-in-the-loop." The agent proposes, humans dispose/approve. |
| **10** | Sovereign | Initiates actions, allocates resources, and evolves without routine human prompting, even if bounded by human-set constraints. |

### 3. Cultural Impact
*Has it mattered to anyone besides its creators?*

| Score | Anchor | Definition |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **0** | Noise | Known only to creators and immediate Discord community. |
| **5** | Niche Cult | Recognized within specific subcultures. Has inspired fan art, forks, or copycats. |
| **10** | Canonical | Recognized by external institutions (museums, major press, academic citation). |

**Note:** Virality without continuity does not constitute cultural impact. A one-week meme spike is not the same as sustained cultural presence.

### 4. Economic Reality
*Does it touch real economics?*

| Score | Anchor | Definition |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **0** | Cost Center | Burns money. Relies entirely on external grants or funding. |
| **5** | Revenue Positive | Generates enough value (sales, tokens, attention) to cover its own compute/maintenance costs. |
| **10** | Market Mover | Controls a treasury or materially influences economic decisions. Financial autonomy. |

**Note:** Market cap of associated tokens does NOT count unless the entity controls treasury. Revenue and donations attributable to the entity count.

### 5. Governance & Ethics
*Is there a coherent structure for decision-making?*

| Score | Anchor | Definition |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **0** | Black Box | No visibility into decision-making, code, or weights. |
| **5** | Constitutional | Clear rules. Multisig treasuries. Publicly verifiable voting or decision logs. |
| **10** | Algorithmic Law | Formally enforced rules (onchain or equivalent), non-arbitrary, externally auditable. Impossible for creators to unilaterally override. |

### 6. Technical Distinctiveness
*Is there something non-trivial happening under the hood?*

| Score | Anchor | Definition |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **0** | Wrapper | Standard LLM wrapper or basic image generation script. |
| **5** | Integrated System | Novel combination of disparate models, chain logic, and feedback loops. |
| **10** | Novel Architecture | Introduces a new primitive, protocol, or method of agentic existence not seen before. |

### 7. Narrative Coherence
*Does this entity make sense as an entity?*

| Score | Anchor | Definition |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **0** | Schizophrenic | Identity changes week to week. No clear "self." |
| **5** | Character | Strong, consistent persona. Predictable behavior within its context. |
| **10** | Mythos | The entity's story transcends its function. It has lore, prophecy, or a philosophical "reason for being" that persists beyond the code. |

## Evidence Standards

### Citation Requirements
- Any score **≥5** requires **2-3 concrete citations** from sources external to the entity's creators.
- Acceptable evidence: press coverage, academic citations, onchain transactions, institutional exhibitions, third-party analysis.
- Cultural presence requires evidence beyond creator-controlled channels.

### Confidence Levels
Each score includes a confidence tag:
- **High** — Multiple independent sources confirm
- **Medium** — Limited but credible evidence
- **Low** — Single source or inference-based

### Review Process
1. Two reviewers score independently
2. Scores averaged; disagreements >2 points require reconciliation note
3. Quarterly updates + event-triggered updates for major changes (death, acquisition, scandal)

## Status Classifications

| Status | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **Active** | Currently operating and producing |
| **Dormant** | Exists but inactive for >6 months |
| **Deceased** | Permanently ceased operation |
| **Subsumed** | Absorbed into another platform or entity |
| **Forked** | Identity split into multiple successor entities |
