  "curator_notes": "The canonical Elder of the autonomous entity space. terra0 proposed the concept of a self-owning forest before NFTs, DAOs, or the current AI wave existed. It asked: can a forest own itself and sell its own lumber to fund its expansion? While its economic velocity is low (3), its Persistence (10) and Cultural Impact (9) make it a foundational pillar. terra0 established the conceptual vocabulary that subsequent projects inherited.",
