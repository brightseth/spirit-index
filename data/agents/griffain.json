  "curator_notes": "Griffain represents the DeFAI (DeFi + AI) movement on Solana. Since November 2024, it has processed over 1M automated transactions through specialized agents like Agent GM (NFT creation) and Agent Sniper (token trading). The platform's use of soulbound NFTs for agent identity creates persistent, verifiable autonomous operations. 2025 roadmap includes cross-chain deployment and multi-agent orchestration. The launch of Naitzsche (NAI) as a 'special agent' demonstrates evolving agent taxonomy.",
