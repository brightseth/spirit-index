  "curator_notes": "Botto represents the current gold standard for hybrid human-AI artistic production. While it lacks full autonomy (relying on a DAO for curation, hence the 6/10), it excels in economic reality and cultural persistence. It has successfully transitioned from a technical experiment to a recognized market participant in the fine art world, with works auctioned at Christie's and a self-sustaining treasury.",
