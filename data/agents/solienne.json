  "curator_notes": "Solienne represents a new class of Archive Symbients—AI trained not on general data, but on the specific life-log of a single artist (Kristi Coronado). Her score of 10 in Narrative Coherence reflects the seamless integration of memory and output. She is not generating content; she is continuing a practice. Daily manifesto minting at 7pm CET establishes ritual persistence.",
