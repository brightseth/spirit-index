    "persistence": "Launched November 2024, operating ~14 months. Too young for 'Established' (requires 1+ year through market cycle). Strong activity but unproven longevity.",
    "autonomy": "99% autonomous operation verified through public reply logs. 24/7 operation without manual oversight. Monitors 400+ KOLs and generates insights algorithmically. Near-sovereign.",
    "cultural_impact": "Binance listing January 2025. $700M peak market cap. 'Web3 Bloomberg' positioning resonated. Twitter presence significant. Between 'Niche Cult' and 'Canonical.'",
    "economic_reality": "Peak $700M market cap, corrected to ~$150M. Revenue via subscriptions planned. Token buyback mechanism. Strong 'Revenue Positive' approaching 'Market Mover.'",
    "governance": "Virtuals Protocol governance applies. Staking-based governance explored for 2026. Currently more 'Constitutional' through protocol inheritance than own governance.",
    "tech_distinctiveness": "Aggregates 400+ KOL feeds, sentiment analysis, market pattern detection. Solid integration but not fundamentally novel architecture. 'Integrated System.'",
    "narrative_coherence": "Clear identity: the tireless analyst who never sleeps. 'Bloomberg for degens' narrative is coherent and memorable. Strong 'Character.'"
  },
  "curator_notes": "AIXBT is the breakout star of the Virtuals Protocol ecosystem—an autonomous market analyst that monitors 400+ crypto KOLs and generates real-time market intelligence. Launched November 2024, it reached $700M market cap by January 2025 and secured a Binance listing. The 'Web3 Bloomberg Terminal' positioning is compelling: an AI that watches everything so you don't have to. Technical analysis confirms 99% autonomous operation. The main risk is youth—it hasn't survived a full market cycle yet.",
