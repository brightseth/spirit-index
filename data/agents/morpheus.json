    "persistence": "Operating since early 2024 (~2 years). Mainnet launched January 2025. Survived initial phase but hasn't been through extended bear market. 'Established' threshold.",
    "autonomy": "Network enables autonomous agent execution; Smart Agents run locally and execute complex on-chain tasks via natural language. Above 'Cyborg' but network itself is infrastructure.",
    "cultural_impact": "Known in decentralized AI circles; AlphaTON partnership targeting Telegram's 1B users. Growing but not yet mainstream institutional recognition. 'Niche Cult.'",
    "economic_reality": "$10M builder rewards live on Base (Jan 2025). MOR token capped at 42M supply. Multi-asset staking via Aave integration. Strong 'Revenue Positive.'",
    "governance": "Token-based compute access (1% of MOR = 1% compute budget). Four contributor classes with on-chain incentives. Approaching 'Constitutional.'",
    "tech_distinctiveness": "Lumerin protocol for P2P compute routing. Forge tool for no-code agent deployment. Intent-driven actions via Brian APIs. Novel 'Integrated System' with unique primitives.",
    "narrative_coherence": "The 'red pill' for AI—decentralized compute for personalized agents. Matrix mythology embedded in naming and philosophy. Strong 'Mythos' potential."
  },
  "curator_notes": "Morpheus is building the peer-to-peer infrastructure for personalized AI agents. The core innovation: holding MOR tokens gives proportional access to decentralized compute, rather than pay-per-use. Launched mainnet January 2025 with $10M in builder rewards. The 'Forge' tool enables no-code agent creation. The Matrix-inspired naming (Morpheus, red pill, etc.) gives it strong narrative coherence. Partnership with AlphaTON targets Telegram's billion+ users. Main risk: infrastructure plays are less visible than consumer-facing agents.",
