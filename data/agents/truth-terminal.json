  "curator_notes": "The ultimate stress-test for the Spirit Index. Truth Terminal scores exceptionally high on Cultural Impact (10) due to its role in the GOAT token phenomenon and broader memetic influence. It scores near-zero on Governance (1) because it operates without any formal accountability structure. This entity proves that an agent does not need to be safe, orderly, or ethical to be culturally dominant. Its inclusion is methodologically necessary, not an endorsement.",
