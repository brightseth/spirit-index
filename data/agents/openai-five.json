  "curator_notes": "OpenAI Five achieved what many considered impossible—defeating the Dota 2 world champions in a best-of-three series. The system trained on the equivalent of 180 years of gameplay daily, using 256 GPUs and 128,000 CPU cores over 10 months. During a public event, OpenAI Five won 99.4% of 42,729 games against human players. Perhaps most remarkable: despite training exclusively in competitive settings, OpenAI Five demonstrated emergent cooperative behavior when teamed with humans. The project's techniques were later adapted for physical robotics, demonstrating transfer potential beyond gaming.",
