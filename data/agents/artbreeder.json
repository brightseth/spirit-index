  "curator_notes": "Artbreeder pioneered the collaborative approach to AI art generation. Founded by Joël Simon (Morphogen collective) in 2018 as Ganbreeder, it predates the DALL-E/Midjourney wave by years. The platform's unique 'breeding' metaphor treats images as organisms with genes (slider parameters) that can be crossbred with any public image. This creates evolutionary, community-driven image creation rather than prompt-response generation. While less commercially successful than later services, Artbreeder's influence on generative art methodology—iterative, collaborative, evolutionary—remains significant. Recent updates integrate SD-XL and ControlNet.",
