    "persistence": "Released March 2023, ~3 years. Continuous development but peak hype passed. Active GitHub repository.",
    "autonomy": "Chains together LLM thoughts to autonomously achieve goals. Breaks user-defined goals into sub-tasks. Self-plans, executes, refines based on feedback. High autonomy within task scope.",
    "cultural_impact": "Ignited Spring 2023 AI agent craze. Mainstream media coverage (Fortune, Fast Company). Defined public conception of 'autonomous AI agent.' BabyAGI, AgentGPT followed.",
    "economic_reality": "Open-source, no direct revenue model. High API costs for users. Spawned ecosystem of agent frameworks but limited commercial success for project itself.",
    "governance": "Open-source (Significant Gravitas). Community contributions. No formal governance structure.",
    "tech_distinctiveness": "First mainstream implementation of autonomous goal-pursuing agent. Task decomposition, real-time feedback refinement. Pioneered the 'agent loop' pattern.",
    "narrative_coherence": "'AI that achieves goals for you.' Clear, compelling pitch. Associated with AGI aspirations (and risks). Strong narrative even if exaggerated."
  },
  "curator_notes": "Auto-GPT, released by Toran Bruce Richards in March 2023, ignited the autonomous AI agent craze. The project demonstrated that GPT-4 could chain together reasoning steps to autonomously pursue user-defined goals, breaking them into sub-tasks and refining approaches based on feedback. While technically limited (high API costs, tendency to loop), Auto-GPT's cultural impact was enormous—it defined public understanding of AI agents and spawned imitators like BabyAGI and AgentGPT. Richards originally wanted an AI to email him daily AI news; he ended up creating the template for the 2023-2024 agent explosion.",
