  "curator_notes": "Ameca represents the current state of the art in humanoid facial expression. Engineered Arts' 2021 robot went viral for its uncannily realistic facial movements—17 motors produce expressions that cross the uncanny valley. Unlike mobility-focused humanoids (Boston Dynamics, Tesla Bot), Ameca prioritizes human-robot interaction through expression. The platform can run GPT-3 or other AI, making it a chassis for others' intelligence. 2025 developments include Generation 3 hardware and US expansion with $16.2M in funding. Ameca's genderless, grey-skinned aesthetic has become iconic in humanoid robotics.",
