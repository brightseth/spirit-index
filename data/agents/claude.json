  "curator_notes": "Claude represents Anthropic's attempt to build AI that is 'principled before powerful.' The Constitutional AI approach trains models on explicit written principles rather than relying solely on human feedback—a methodological innovation that influenced industry thinking on alignment. Claude 3 introduced the Opus/Sonnet/Haiku tiering; Claude 4 (May 2025) brought Claude Code from research preview to general availability with 8-hour autonomous runs. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables Claude to connect with external tools. Anthropic's 'helpful, harmless, honest' framing provides arguably the strongest narrative identity of any major AI assistant.",
