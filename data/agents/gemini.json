  "curator_notes": "Google Gemini represents the tech giant's flagship AI system, designed explicitly for the 'agentic era.' Launched December 2023, Gemini unified Google's AI efforts (replacing Bard) and introduced native multimodality—images, audio, and video processed together, not separately. Gemini 1.5 Pro's 1M+ token context window set new standards. Gemini 2.0 (December 2024) introduced Project Astra (universal AI agent), Project Mariner (autonomous browser control), and Jules (AI coding agent). The system's integration across Google products—Android, Gmail, Search—provides unmatched distribution.",
