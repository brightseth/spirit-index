    "cultural_impact": "Pioneer of neural network music generation. Academic influence significant. Used by artists and producers. Less mainstream visibility than Suno/AIVA.",

  "curator_notes": "Google Magenta represents the academic vanguard of AI music generation. Launched in 2016 by Google Brain, Magenta asked: 'Can machine learning create compelling art and music?' The project pioneered neural network approaches to composition using RNNs, VAEs (MusicVAE, GrooVAE), and WaveNet. Unlike commercial services, Magenta emphasizes 'extend not replace'—smart tools that enhance human creativity. The 2024 Magenta RealTime release is the first open-weights model for continuous real-time music generation, enabling live performance, installations, and games. TensorFlow-based, all tools are open source on GitHub.",
