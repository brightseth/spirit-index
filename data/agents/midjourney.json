  "curator_notes": "Midjourney is the most culturally influential AI image generator, responsible for the 2022 Colorado State Fair controversy when Jason Allen's 'Théâtre D'opéra Spatial' won first place. A 60-person self-funded research lab, Midjourney focuses on aesthetic quality over raw capability—David Holz states 'the commercial index is less important than the sense of humanity.' While purely a tool (no autonomous agency), Midjourney has shaped public perception of AI art more than any other service. Its Discord-based community and rapid iteration (4 major versions in 2022 alone) created the template for AI art services.",
