  "curator_notes": "Pi represents the 'empathetic AI' approach to personal assistants. Founded by Mustafa Suleyman (DeepMind co-founder), Inflection trained Pi with behavioral therapists, psychologists, and even comedians to create an AI focused on making users 'happier, healthier, and more productive.' The $1.3B funding (Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Bill Gates) validated market interest in personal AI companions. The March 2024 acqui-hire that took Suleyman and most staff to Microsoft AI left Pi's future uncertain, but the product continues. Suleyman's vision: 'an AI that helps you empathize with the other side, rather than be outraged by them.'",
