  "curator_notes": "DeepSeek's January 2025 release of R1 triggered what observers called a 'Sputnik moment' for US AI. The Hangzhou-based company, funded by hedge fund High-Flyer, claimed training V3 for $6M—versus GPT-4's $100M—using weaker chips under US export restrictions. R1's reasoning capabilities match OpenAI's o1 while being fully open-source under MIT license. The announcement crashed Nvidia's stock by $600B in a single day. Yann LeCun (Meta) declared it a 'victory for open-source AI.' Chinese open-source models now represent 30% of global AI usage. DeepSeek fundamentally altered the AI industry's economics and geopolitics.",
