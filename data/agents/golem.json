  "curator_notes": "Golem Network pioneered the decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) concept, launching in 2016 with the vision of creating a peer-to-peer marketplace for computing power. The project raised 820,000 ETH (~$8.6M at the time) by selling 82% of tokens to the public. Golem enables users to rent out idle computing resources or access distributed compute for AI training, CGI rendering, and scientific computation. The 2024 AI roadmap and GPU Beta Program demonstrate evolution toward AI infrastructure. While Golem is infrastructure rather than an autonomous agent, it enables the computational substrate many agents depend on.",
