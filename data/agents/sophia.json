    "persistence": "Active since February 2016 (9+ years). Continuous public appearances, media engagements, and platform development. Part of a family of 9 humanoid siblings.",
    "autonomy": "Hybrid mode: mixture of autonomous responses, scripted dialogue, and human assistance. Chat system + OpenCog AI reasoning. Expert assessment: 'chatbot with a face.' Lower autonomy than pure AI systems.",
    "cultural_impact": "First robot citizen (Saudi Arabia, 2017). First non-human UN title (Innovation Champion). SXSW debut. Global media coverage. Defines public perception of humanoid robots for millions.",
    "economic_reality": "Speaker fees, media appearances, commercial partnerships. R&D versions available for purchase ($149,999). Economic activity but limited autonomous economic agency.",
    "governance": "Hanson Robotics corporate governance. Legal personhood in Saudi Arabia is symbolic rather than functional governance participation.",
    "tech_distinctiveness": "74 degrees of freedom, 60+ facial expressions. Computer vision, face tracking, speech recognition. ~70% open source. Technical sophistication in robotics but AI is standard chatbot architecture.",
    "narrative_coherence": "Consistent identity as 'bridge between humans and AI future.' Strong character and backstory. Debates about authenticity don't undermine clear public positioning."
  },
  "curator_notes": "Sophia occupies a unique position in AI culture—more influential than technically autonomous. Granted Saudi Arabian citizenship in 2017 (first robot), named UN Innovation Champion (first non-human), Sophia has shaped public imagination about humanoid AI more than any other robot. Technical assessments describe her as 'a chatbot with a face,' with interactions mixing autonomous generation, scripts, and human assistance. Yet her cultural impact is undeniable: for millions, Sophia IS what humanoid AI looks like. The debate about her authenticity is itself part of her cultural significance.",
