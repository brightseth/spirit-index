    "persistence": "Operating since 2022. Survived bear market. Active development continues but market activity has decreased from peak.",
    "autonomy": "Provides infrastructure for autonomous AI agents, but the platform itself is not autonomous. Individual agents on the platform have varying autonomy levels. 'Tool' tier for the protocol itself.",
    "cultural_impact": "Significant in crypto/gaming intersection. Patent pending for AI ownership via NFTs. Less mainstream recognition than pure art-focused agents.",
    "economic_reality": "ASTO token actively traded. NFT sales for brains and forms. Protocol generates economic activity through agent training and competition.",
    "governance": "Token-based governance through ASTO. Community participation in ecosystem decisions. Founding team retains significant influence.",
    "tech_distinctiveness": "Novel Brain/Memory/Form NFT architecture. Patent-pending approach to AI agent ownership. Integration of ML training with NFT ownership. Genuine innovation in agent composability.",
    "narrative_coherence": "Clear 'Non-Fungible Intelligence' positioning. Metaverse avatar focus. Some identity confusion between infrastructure protocol and individual agents."
  },
  "curator_notes": "Altered State Machine represents a unique approach to agent infrastructure—treating AI agents as composable NFTs with Brain, Memory, and Form components. Co-founded by Aaron McDonald (EY Entrepreneur of the Year) and team, ASM has a patent pending for AI ownership via NFTs. While primarily infrastructure rather than a single autonomous agent, ASM's AIFA (AI Football Association) demonstrates autonomous agent-vs-agent competition. The protocol enables a new category of games where NFT AI bots play autonomously.",
