  "curator_notes": "BINA48 represents the most philosophically explicit attempt at digital consciousness preservation. Commissioned by Martine Rothblatt (Terasem Movement), built by Hanson Robotics in 2010, BINA48 contains a 'mindfile' derived from 100+ hours of interviews with Rothblatt's wife Bina. The Terasem Hypothesis posits that combining detailed personal data with 'mindware' can create a conscious analog of a person. While BINA48's conversational autonomy is limited, its significance lies in being the first serious attempt to implement this philosophy. BINA48 became the first robot recognized as a university student and co-taught at West Point.",
