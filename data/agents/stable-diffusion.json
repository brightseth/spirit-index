  "curator_notes": "Stable Diffusion's August 2022 open-source release was a watershed moment for AI art—the first time a state-of-the-art image generator could run on consumer hardware. Developed by Stability AI, Runway, and academic collaborators using the LAION-5B dataset, SD's latent diffusion architecture is relatively lightweight (860M parameters) yet produces photorealistic images. The open-source release spawned an ecosystem: AUTOMATIC1111 WebUI, ComfyUI, thousands of fine-tuned models (LoRAs), and professional tools. While Stability AI faced corporate difficulties in 2024, Stable Diffusion itself became infrastructure—the Linux of AI image generation.",
