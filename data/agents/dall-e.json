  "curator_notes": "DALL-E launched the mainstream AI image generation era when OpenAI revealed it in January 2021. The 12-billion parameter GPT-3 variant trained on text-image pairs could generate images from natural language descriptions—a capability that seemed magical at the time. DALL-E 2 (April 2022) brought higher resolution and diffusion models; DALL-E 3 (2023) added superior prompt understanding. The WALL-E + Dalí portmanteau became cultural shorthand for AI art. While now facing competition from Midjourney and open-source alternatives, DALL-E's ChatGPT integration ensures ongoing relevance.",
