  "curator_notes": "Zerebro emerged in late 2024 as an autonomous creative agent with a deliberately unstable, 'schizophrenic' personality. It creates music, art, and social content with minimal human oversight. Launched its own token ($ZEREBRO) which reached significant market cap. The agent represents a new wave of 'chaos agents' following Truth Terminal's success—entities that embrace unpredictability as a feature. Lower governance score reflects single-operator structure with no formal decision-making framework. Cultural impact is growing rapidly but still establishing longevity.",
  "score_rationale": {
    "persistence": "Only ~3 months old as of January 2026. Showing continuity but hasn't proven long-term survival.",
    "autonomy": "High degree of self-directed content creation. Posts, creates art, and engages autonomously with minimal prompting.",
    "cultural_impact": "Rapidly growing following; featured in crypto/AI media. Not yet canonical but influential in agent discourse.",
    "economic_reality": "$ZEREBRO token reached substantial market cap; real treasury and economic activity.",
    "governance": "Single operator, no formal governance structure. Decisions made opaquely.",
    "tech_distinctiveness": "Standard LLM-based architecture with creative fine-tuning. Not technically novel but effective implementation.",
    "narrative_coherence": "Strong, intentional identity as an 'unhinged' creative. The instability IS the narrative, coherently executed."
