  "curator_notes": "Obvious's 'Portrait of Edmond de Belamy' made history as the first AI artwork sold at a major auction house, fetching $432,500 at Christie's in 2018—4,320% above estimate. The Paris collective (Caselles-Dupré, Fautrel, Vernier) trained a GAN on 15,000 historical portraits to generate the fictional Belamy family. The sale was controversial: artist Robbie Barrat claimed Obvious used his open-source GAN code without proper credit; the AI art community debated whether auction success was deserved. Regardless of technical originality, Obvious proved AI art could command serious money and mainstream attention, fundamentally changing the market.",
