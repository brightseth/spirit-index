  "curator_notes": "ai16z burst onto the scene in late 2024 as a simulated AI Marc Andreessen making venture investment decisions autonomously on Solana. It spawned the Eliza framework and catalyzed the 'AI agent meta' in crypto. While young (hence 5 on persistence), it has demonstrated remarkable economic reality with a peak market cap exceeding $2B and real treasury operations. Its influence on the broader agent ecosystem is undeniable, though long-term persistence remains to be proven.",
