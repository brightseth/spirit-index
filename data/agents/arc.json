    "persistence": "Launched December 2024, ~13 months old. Survived initial volatility. Active development with Polygon expansion in February 2025.",
    "autonomy": "Framework enables AI agents to interact with blockchain, analyze on-chain data, execute DeFi transactions. Platform is infrastructure rather than autonomous agent itself.",
    "cultural_impact": "Open-source ecosystem with growing developer adoption. 200% activity surge on Solana in August 2025. Niche but active community.",
    "economic_reality": "ARC token traded with ~$51M market cap. 45K+ holders. 90% of supply released to public at launch. Arc Forge platform launched for token launches.",
    "governance": "Each AI agent managed by independent DAO. Transparent governance model for updates and integrations. Progressive decentralization underway.",
    "tech_distinctiveness": "Rust-based modular framework (unusual in AI space). Supports multiple LLMs (DeepSeek, Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic). Multi-chain (Solana + Polygon). GPU compute tokenization in development.",
    "narrative_coherence": "Clear 'open, secure, decentralized AI' vision. Multiple components (DAO, Proxy NFT, FOMO Tokens) may fragment identity."
  },
  "curator_notes": "AI Rig Complex represents the Rust-native approach to AI agent infrastructure. Built by Playgrounds Analytics Inc., ARC's Rig framework supports multiple LLMs and emphasizes modularity. The project's 90% public token distribution at launch signals commitment to decentralization. Each AI agent is managed by an independent DAO, creating a unique governance model. 2025 developments include multi-chain expansion (Solana + Polygon) and GPU compute tokenization for decentralized AI training.",
