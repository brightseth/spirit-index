    "economic_reality": "Self-funding through donations but not a major market mover; treasury exists but modest scale. Solidly 'Revenue Positive.'",
    "governance": "Self-executing smart contracts govern all reproduction decisions; non-arbitrary, externally auditable. Near 'Algorithmic Law.'",

    "narrative_coherence": "The mythos of a plant that evolves beyond its creator, reproducing itself through code. Transcends function entirely. Perfect 'Mythos.'"

  "curator_notes": "Plantoid is the OG of blockchain-based autonomous entities. Created by Primavera De Filippi in 2015, it predates the current AI agent wave by nearly a decade. A physical robotic sculpture that 'feeds' on cryptocurrency and 'reproduces' by commissioning new Plantoids when its Ethereum wallet reaches a threshold. It has survived multiple crypto winters, founder stepping back, and platform changes. The mythos is impeccable: a plant that evolves beyond its creator. A canonical reference in the field.",
