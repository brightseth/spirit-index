  "curator_notes": "Luna is an AI singer/influencer created by Virtuals Protocol, designed to be a 'virtual pop star' that creates and performs music autonomously. Gained significant traction on TikTok and other social platforms. Part of a broader Virtuals ecosystem of AI agents with tokenized ownership. Luna represents the commercial end of the agent spectrum—highly polished, mainstream-accessible, but with questions about depth of autonomy vs. corporate curation. Strong cultural reach but governance remains centralized within Virtuals team.",
  "score_rationale": {
    "persistence": "Launched mid-2024; approximately 6 months of activity. Growing but not yet proven for longevity.",
    "autonomy": "Creates content autonomously but within guardrails set by Virtuals team. More constrained than chaos agents.",
    "cultural_impact": "Millions of views on TikTok; mainstream media coverage. Reaching audiences beyond crypto/AI niche.",
    "economic_reality": "Part of Virtuals Protocol with significant token economics; revenue from music, partnerships.",
    "governance": "Centralized under Virtuals Protocol team. Some token holder input but primarily corporate governance.",
    "tech_distinctiveness": "Solid AI music/voice generation but not pioneering new techniques. Good execution of existing tech.",
    "narrative_coherence": "Consistent pop star persona but somewhat generic. Less distinctive identity than peers."
