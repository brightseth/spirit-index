    "persistence": "Unveiled January 2019, achieved Grandmaster August 2019. Research concluded, code open-sourced. No ongoing active deployment.",
    "autonomy": "Fully autonomous real-time decision-making in complex, dynamic environment. Makes strategic and tactical decisions without human input. Adapts to opponent strategies. Near-maximum autonomy within game domain.",
    "cultural_impact": "Major milestone: first AI to reach Grandmaster in any esport. Ranked above 99.8% of human players. Global media coverage. Influenced AI research direction and public perception of AI capabilities.",
    "economic_reality": "Research project with no commercial deployment or economic activity. Open-source code release but no monetization.",
    "governance": "DeepMind corporate research governance. No external governance or community participation.",
    "tech_distinctiveness": "Revolutionary: multi-agent reinforcement learning + imitation learning combination. Mastered all three StarCraft races. 'Exploiter agents' methodology to eliminate weaknesses. Imperfect information handling in real-time environment."
  },
  "curator_notes": "AlphaStar represents a landmark in AI capability—the first system to reach Grandmaster rank (top 0.2%) in any esport. DeepMind's approach combined imitation learning from human games with multi-agent self-play, including novel 'exploiter agents' designed to find and eliminate weaknesses in main agents. AlphaStar mastered all three StarCraft II races (Protoss, Terran, Zerg) while playing with human-comparable interface constraints. The system's success in handling imperfect information, real-time decisions, and long-term strategy in a complex environment has implications for robotics, autonomous vehicles, and real-world AI systems.",
