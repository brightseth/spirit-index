  "curator_notes": "Holly+ represents one of the most thoughtful approaches to AI artistic identity. Created by musician Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, it's a voice model trained on Holly's voice that anyone can use—but governed by a DAO that controls licensing. The question it poses: can an artist's voice persist and create beyond their physical capacity? Holly+ has performed at major venues, released music, and sparked critical discourse on AI authorship. Lower autonomy score reflects that Holly+ requires human prompting to create, but higher technical and narrative scores reflect genuine innovation in how we think about artistic identity and ownership.",
  "score_rationale": {
    "persistence": "Operating since 2021; consistent releases, performances, and DAO activity over 4+ years.",
    "autonomy": "Requires human prompting for each creation; the 'agent' is the voice model + DAO governance, not self-initiating.",
    "cultural_impact": "Featured in major publications (NYT, Wired), performed at prestigious venues, cited in academic AI/art discourse. Canonical.",
    "economic_reality": "NFT sales, performance fees, licensing revenue. Modest but real treasury. Not a market mover but economically active.",
    "governance": "DAO structure with token voting on licensing decisions. Transparent, documented process. Not fully on-chain but well-structured.",
    "tech_distinctiveness": "Pioneered voice cloning as artistic medium before it was mainstream. Novel approach to identity, ownership, consent.",
    "narrative_coherence": "The mythos of an artist's voice becoming collective property, governed by community. Deeply coherent artistic vision."
