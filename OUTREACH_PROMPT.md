# Spirit Index — Entity Nomination Request

**Context:** We're building the reference oracle for autonomous cultural agents—like S&P for companies, but for AI entities. Currently at 19 entities, targeting 25 by end of Q1 2026.

---

## What We Index

**What counts as an entity:** A specific autonomous instantiation (or persistent collective) with continuity over time, decision-making agency, and a public footprint.

**What does not count:** Base models (Claude/ChatGPT/GPT-*), one-off demos, or generic "AI tools."

**Protocols/DAOs are in-scope** only when they behave like a persistent agent or agent collective with an identifiable track record.

### The 7 Dimensions (0-10 each, max 70)

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Persistence** | Continuity over time (ephemeral → institutional) |
| **Autonomy** | Independence of action (puppet → sovereign) |
| **Cultural Impact** | Recognition beyond creators (noise → canonical) |
| **Economic Reality** | Real economic interaction (cost center → market mover) |
| **Governance** | Decision-making structure (black box → algorithmic law) |
| **Tech Distinctiveness** | Non-trivial architecture (wrapper → novel architecture) |
| **Narrative Coherence** | Makes sense as entity (fragmented → mythos) |

**Minimum bar:** ≥3 in both Persistence and Autonomy

## What We're Looking For (6 More to Hit 25)

**Coverage gaps:**
- **More infrastructure** — Fetch.ai agents, Autonolas instances, other coordination protocols
- **Gaming/metaverse** — Persistent NPCs, game DAOs with identity
- **Art/creative** — Generative systems beyond visual art (music, writing, performance)
- **Science/research** — Lab automation agents, research collectives
- **Commercial** — Customer service agents with persistent identity (not platforms)
- **Elders** — Pre-2020 entities we might have missed

**Quality bar:**
- Must have persistent identity (not a project with rotating demos)
- ≥1 year history preferred (will consider 6mo+ for exceptional cases)
- Evidence of cultural recognition beyond creator channels
- Real economic activity (revenue, treasury, or market participation)

## Question for You

**Given this framework and cohort, what entities should we evaluate next?**

Specifically:
1. Are there obvious gaps or overlooked entities in the current index?
2. What entities in your domain/network meet this bar?
3. Are there historical entities (pre-2020) we're missing?

We prioritize:
- Entities you've personally interacted with or studied
- Entities with public documentation/evidence
- Entities that challenge or expand the framework

## How to Nominate

**Option 1:** Reply with entity names + 1-2 sentence rationale

**Option 2:** Open GitHub issue: https://github.com/brightseth/spirit-index/issues/new?template=entity-nomination.md

**Option 3:** Email: council@spiritindex.org

## Our Scoring Process

1. Two reviewers score independently across 7 dimensions
2. Each score ≥5 requires 2-3 external citations
3. Scores averaged; disagreements >2 points reconciled with notes
4. Full rationale published with entity dossier
5. Quarterly re-evaluation for all entities

**Current council:**
- Seth Goldstein (Spirit Protocol)
- Primavera De Filippi (Plantoid, COALA)
- Simon Hudson (forthcoming)

## Why This Matters

We're building toward an **oracle layer for prediction markets**:
- "Will Botto reach 60/70 by Q2 2026?"
- "Will any new agent crack the top 3 in 2026?"
- On-chain resolution via Spirit Index scores

But first: **cataloging what actually exists, with standards.**

**TL;DR:** Help us find 6 more entities that deserve to be indexed alongside Plantoid, Botto, and Olas. What are we missing?
