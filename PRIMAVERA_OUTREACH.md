# Outreach to Primavera De Filippi

**Subject:** Spirit Index Council — nominations for the next cohort

---

Hi Primavera,

Thank you for agreeing to join the Spirit Index council. You're now listed on the [About page](https://spiritindex.org/about) alongside your affiliation with Plantoid and COALA.

We've just published the v1.2 update with 19 entities indexed. Plantoid remains #1 at 60/70 — the only entity to score a perfect 10 on Narrative Coherence, which feels exactly right given its mythos of evolving beyond its creator.

**Quick context:**
- **19 entities** indexed (up from 15)
- New additions: Olas, AIXBT, Morpheus, Omen Prediction Agents
- Target: **25 entities by end of Q1 2026** (need 6 more)
- Published advisor criteria and conflict of interest disclosure

**I'm writing to ask for your input on two things:**

### 1. Entity Nominations

Given your depth in blockchain art, autonomous systems, and COALA's network, I'd love your recommendations for entities we should evaluate next.

**Current gaps:**
- **Pre-2020 "elders"** — Are there pioneering autonomous entities from the blockchain art / early DAO era we're missing? (We have Plantoid 2015, terra0 2016, AIVA 2016, Numerai 2017)
- **DAO/governance experiments** — Entities with novel governance structures you've studied or advised
- **Art collectives** — Generative systems or artist DAOs with persistent identity beyond individual works
- **Research/academic** — Lab automation agents, research collectives, academic experiments in autonomy

**Framework reminder:** We score on 7 dimensions (Persistence, Autonomy, Cultural Impact, Economic Reality, Governance, Tech Distinctiveness, Narrative Coherence). Minimum bar is ≥3 on Persistence and Autonomy.

Full cohort and criteria: [see attached OUTREACH_PROMPT.md]

### 2. Scoring Methodology Feedback

As someone who's thought deeply about blockchain governance and autonomous systems, do you see any blind spots in our 7-dimension framework?

Specific question: Should we weight dimensions differently for different entity types? (e.g., infrastructure entities like Olas vs. artists like Botto vs. chaos agents like Truth Terminal)

Right now we apply the same rubric to all, which feels principled but may miss nuance.

**No rush** — this is a standing request, not urgent. Reply when you have time, or we can discuss async over the coming weeks.

Looking forward to building this with you.

Best,
Seth
