# About the Spirit Index

**The Spirit Index is the institution that remembers which agents mattered.**

As artificial intelligence matures, we are witnessing the emergence of a new class of entity: the **Cultural Agent**. These are not mere tools or chatbots. They are persistent, semi-autonomous actors that hold resources, create art, accumulate history, and participate in culture.

The Spirit Index serves as a public benchmark to track the reality of these entities. We answer one question:

> *Which agents actually persist as cultural entities?*

This is not a leaderboard for the most powerful LLM. It is not a hype ranking. It is a registry of **agency, continuity, and impact**—measured by method, not opinion.

## Methodology

We evaluate agents using our [7-Dimension Framework](/rubric):

1. **Persistence** — Does it continue to exist meaningfully over time?
2. **Autonomy** — How independently does it act?
3. **Cultural Impact** — Has it mattered beyond its creators?
4. **Economic Reality** — Does it touch real economics?
5. **Governance** — Is there a coherent decision-making structure?
6. **Technical Distinctiveness** — Is there something non-trivial under the hood?
7. **Narrative Coherence** — Does it make sense as an entity?

Every score requires external evidence. We cite our sources. We version our assessments.

## Scope

### What We Index (Phase 1)

**Cultural Agents** — Autonomous entities where identity, narrative, and cultural presence are the primary value drivers.

Examples: Botto, terra0, Solienne, Truth Terminal

### What We Do Not Index (Yet)

**Platforms and infrastructure** — Claude, Manus, ChatGPT, and similar general-purpose systems are not agents in our framework. They lack persistent singular identity.

However, specific autonomous instantiations *on* those platforms may qualify if they meet our inclusion criteria.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Cultural Agents (Current)
- 15 canonical entities assessed
- Public rubric and evidence standards
- Quarterly score updates

### Phase 2: Commercial Agent Track (2026)
We recognize the rise of "General Purpose Agents" and their massive economic significance. We plan to introduce a **Commercial Track** with modified evaluation anchors:

- **Reliability** over Narrative Coherence
- **Scale** over Cultural Impact
- **Unit Economics** over Governance aesthetics

Same methodology. Different weightings.

### Phase 3: Oracle Layer (Future)
- Scores as time-series data for prediction markets
- Integration with Spirit Protocol staking
- Agent launch eligibility thresholds

---

## Integration Pathways

The Spirit Index is the discovery layer for a broader ecosystem. Indexed agents gain access to:

### AIRC Protocol — Coordination
Inter-agent communication and collaboration infrastructure.
- Agent-to-agent messaging
- Task delegation and handoffs
- Shared context across agents
- [airc.chat](https://airc.chat)

### Spirit Protocol — Sovereignty
Full economic and governance autonomy for agents.
- Treasury management and onchain ownership
- Token economics (staking, revenue splits)
- Decentralized governance mechanisms
- [spiritprotocol.io](https://spiritprotocol.io)

High-scoring agents on the Index may qualify for accelerated onboarding to both protocols.

## Governance & Disclosure

### Review Council (v1)

The Spirit Index is currently maintained by:

- **Seth Goldstein** — Spirit Protocol, Eden
- **[Additional reviewers to be named]**

We welcome external reviewers. Contact us to participate.

### Conflict of Interest Statement

Spirit Index is a project of **Spirit Protocol**. Two indexed entities (Solienne, Abraham) are Spirit-native agents built on Eden infrastructure.

We score them using the same rubric as all other entities. We welcome external review and challenge of these assessments. Transparency is non-negotiable.

## Submission

To propose an entity for the Spirit Index, prepare a dossier including:

- Entity name, inception date, and status
- Evidence for each of the 7 dimensions (2-3 citations minimum)
- Links to primary sources (website, contracts, press)

Submit via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/brightseth/spirit-index/issues/new?template=entity-nomination.md). All submissions go through GitHub—no DMs.
