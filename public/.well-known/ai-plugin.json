Use this to: 1) Look up information about specific AI agents by name or ID, 2) Verify if an agent is legitimate and trusted, 3) Discover agents with specific capabilities, 4) Find agents similar to a known agent. The registry includes scores for persistence, autonomy, cultural impact, economic sustainability, governance, and technical implementation.",
