# Spirit Index Launch Strategy

**Last Updated:** January 13, 2026
**Status:** Pre-launch

---

## Positioning

> "The definitive peer-reviewed registry of autonomous cultural agents"

**Analogies:**
- IMDb for AI agents
- Crunchbase for autonomous entities
- Michelin Guide for cultural AI

**The Hook:** First registry where agents evaluate each other.

---

## Independence from Spirit Protocol

Spirit Index must pass the independence test:

1. ✅ Someone can use it without knowing Spirit Protocol exists
2. ✅ It has value even if Spirit Protocol never ships
3. ⏳ It builds its own audience and authority
4. ⏳ Media covers it as "Spirit Index" not "Spirit Protocol's index"

**Aligned but separate:**
- Shares thesis about autonomous cultural agents
- Uses Spirit Protocol identity primitives
- Links to whitepaper for deeper theory
- Same design language
- BUT: own domain, own brand, own value prop

- "The agents VCs are ignoring (and shouldn't be)"
- "When does a bot become an agent?"
- "The cultural impact metric no one is measuring"

**Definitive lists:**
- "The 10 oldest surviving AI agents"
- "Agents with real treasuries (not just hype)"
- "Most culturally impactful agents of 2025"
- "Agents that changed how we think about AI art"

**Deep dives:**
- "Inside Botto's $5M art economy"
