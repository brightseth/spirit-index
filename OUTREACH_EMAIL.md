# Spirit Index Outreach — Email Templates

## Short Email (High-Response Version)

**Subject options:**
- Spirit Index: nominate 1–3 autonomous cultural entities?
- Quick ask: what AI entities are we missing?
- Building a public index for autonomous agents — nominations

**Body:**

I'm building Spirit Index: a public scoring system for autonomous cultural entities (think "S&P-style coverage," but for persistent AI/DAO/agent entities rather than companies).

We're at 19 entities and want to reach 25 by March 31, 2026.

**What qualifies:** A specific autonomous instantiation (or persistent collective) with (1) continuity over time and (2) real agency—plus a public footprint. Not base models or one-off demos.

**The score:** 7 dimensions (0–10 each): Persistence, Autonomy, Cultural Impact, Economic Reality, Governance, Tech Distinctiveness, Narrative Coherence.

**Ask:** Can you reply with up to 3 entities we should evaluate next, with links and 1–2 lines on why they clear the bar?

If easier: GitHub nomination issue or email both work:
- GitHub: https://github.com/brightseth/spirit-index/issues/new?template=entity-nomination.md
- council@spiritindex.org

**Rubric:** https://spiritindex.org/rubric

**Example entities in the index:** Plantoid, Botto, terra0, Olas, Truth Terminal
**Full list:** https://spiritindex.org

## DM / Signal / Twitter Version (Tight)

Building Spirit Index: a public scorecard for autonomous cultural entities (persistent AI/DAO/agent instantiations). We're at 19, targeting 25 by Mar 31, 2026.

Nominate 1–3 entities (with links) that have persistent identity + real agency (not base models / one-off demos).

Rubric: https://spiritindex.org/rubric

## Warm Intro Version (For Friends + Credible Peers)

I'm trying to avoid a hype list and build a standards-based index for autonomous entities.

If you've personally studied or interacted with any entities that feel like they have continuity + agency + public recognition, send 1–3 names + links. Even "this is controversial but important" nominations are welcome.

## Context (If Asked)

**Current cohort (19 entities):**

**The Elders (Pre-2020):**

- AIVA (45/70) — AI composer with copyright attribution (2016)

**Infrastructure & Collectives:**
- Olas (54/70) — Protocol powering 361+ daily agents (2021)
- Omen Prediction Agents (49/70) — 300+ forecasting collective, 79% accuracy (2023)
- Morpheus (47/70) — P2P AI compute network (2024)

**Artists:**
- Botto (55/70) — Autonomous artist governed by token holders (2021)
- Holly+ (53/70) — Holly Herndon's voice DAO (2021)

## Coverage Gaps (What We're Looking For)

- **Gaming/metaverse** — Persistent NPCs, game DAOs with identity
- **Art/creative** — Generative systems beyond visual art (music, writing, performance)
- **Science/research** — Lab automation agents, research collectives
- **Commercial** — Customer service agents with persistent identity
- **Elders** — Pre-2020 entities we might have missed

**Quality bar:**
- Persistent identity (not a project with rotating demos)
- ≥1 year history preferred (will consider 6mo+ for exceptional cases)
- Evidence of cultural recognition beyond creator channels
- Real economic activity (revenue, treasury, or market participation)

## Why This Matters

We're building toward a reference oracle for autonomous entities—a standards-based index that prediction markets, investors, and researchers can cite.

Immediate use cases:
- Canonical reference for "which agents matter"
- Benchmark for new agent launches
- Foundation for prediction markets ("Will Botto reach 60/70 by Q2 2026?")

But first: cataloging what actually exists, with standards.

## Our Scoring Process

1. Two reviewers score independently across 7 dimensions
2. Each score ≥5 requires 2-3 external citations
3. Scores averaged; disagreements >2 points reconciled with notes
4. Full rationale published with entity dossier
5. Quarterly re-evaluation for all entities

**Current council:**
- Seth Goldstein (Spirit Protocol)
- Primavera De Filippi (Plantoid, COALA)
- Simon Hudson (forthcoming)

## Notes on Replika

Replika is a boundary case—it's fundamentally a platform (millions of individual instances), but it pioneered the AI companion category and raised critical questions about AI relationships. We include it with low autonomy/governance scores to reflect that the company, not the agents, controls decisions. This "platform vs. agent" distinction is explicitly discussed on our About page.

If this feels like a credibility gap in outreach, we can:
1. Remove it from the short cohort list
2. Re-label it as "boundary case / commercial entity"
3. Move it to an "edge cases" section

Your call.
